### The Team
Charlie Guan, Chuan Yun Loe, Daniel Faulkner, Jonathan Lam, Prashant Chhabra

### Description
A web application that puts the power into people's hands for finding sites for sustainable electricity generation. This application is being developed as a project for the Startup Programming class at the University of Victoria.

### Live Demo Link
[Current live version!](http://2-3.power-planner.appspot.com/)

### Use
Use this application to find areas in British Columbia to become electrically self-sustaining or to help others accomplish that dream - find locations that historically provide bright sunlight for your solar panels, strong wind for your turbines, and fast flowing rivers for your mini hydro generators. With a simple-on-the-surface interface, quickly and visually locate just the spot for you, or find the potential in your current area! In the future, you'll be able to navigate around the map easily and view data in a number of informative ways.

### Limitations and Disclaimers
* All data is based off estimates, averages, and simulations. This is meant to guide the user, not give you exact, up-to-the-minute information. Even if it displayed perfect historical accurate data, there can be large variance between years and seasons, and the climate is changing!
* Some of the client side calculations aren't too smart yet. Zoom rapidly or move the map rapidly at your own risk! (Hint: it'll slow to a crawl)
* Data is only available for BC (with some information crawling into surrounding provinces and states)
* Hydro isn't showing yet (soon!)
* Power types cannot be overlaid right now
* The live version is already several awesome features behind!
